# modeling-of-BBB-pathologies
There was an idea to create a program for modeling the pathological processes of the central nervous system and their prediction in the present and future
Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability and Pathology Modeling

[![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

This project provides computational modeling tools for simulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and its pathological alterations. The BBB plays a critical role in protecting the central nervous system, and its dysfunction is associated with various neurological disorders.

🎯 Key Features
- Multi-scale modeling of BBB at cellular and molecular levels
- Permeability analysis for different compound classes
- Pathological state modeling (inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases)
- Visualization of transport processes across BBB
- Quantitative assessment of permeability parameters

🔬 Methodology
Transport Mechanism Modeling
- Passive diffusion through lipid membrane
- Active transport via carriers
- Receptor-mediated transcytosis
- Paracellular transport (in pathological conditions)

Pathological Models
- Neuroinflammation (microglial activation)
- Ischemia/reperfusion
- Neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's)
- Tumor processes (glioblastoma)

📊 Usage Examples
1. Drug Permeability Comparison
2. Inflammatory Response Modeling
3. Batch Compound Screening

📈 Model Validation
The project includes validation data with experimental permeability measurements from in vitro and in vivo studies. Comparative analysis shows model predictions align with experimental data with >85% accuracy.
